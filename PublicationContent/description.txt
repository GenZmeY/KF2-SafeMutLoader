[h1]‚öñÔ∏è Legal[/h1]
Safe Mut Loader is legal and does not violate the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/eula/232090_eula_0]KF2 EULA[/url]. Here's why in detail:
https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader/blob/master/LEGAL.md

However, for some reason Safe Mut Loader is getting banned in the steam workshop, so [b]use it at your own risk[/b].

[h1]üñ•Ô∏è Usage (server only)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If this is unclear, first read: [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server Guide (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url][/i]
[olist]
[*] Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*] Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)
[*] Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=<workshop_id>[/code]
(replace [b]<workshop_id>[/b] with your SML workshop item id)
[*] Start server and wait for mutator download.
[*] When the download is complete, stop the server.
[*] Add [b]SML.Mut[/b] [u]first[/u] to your list of mutators, example:
[code]
?Mutator=SML.Mut,FriendlyHUD.FriendlyHUDMutator,YAS.Mut,CTI.Mut,CVC.Mut,AAL.Mut
[/code]
(add/remove [b]compatible[/b] mutators you need)
[*] Start the server.
[/olist]

[h1]‚ö†Ô∏è Important information:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Doesn't work in single player.
[*] SML must be first in the mutators list or it won't work.
[*] SML only has an effect when [b]compatible[/b] mutators are used. If you use incompatible mutators you will lose ranked status.
[*] SML is a server-side mutator, clients never download it. No one will know about you using SML if you don‚Äôt tell yourself.
[*] SML is incompatible with [url=https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/utility-admin-access-plus-manager.118740/]AccessPlus[/url] and other mods based on it. If you need something from there, implement it as an SML compatible mutator using [url=https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader/blob/master/DEV.md]developer guide[/url].
