[h1][b]Use non-whitelisted mutators and stay ranked[/b][/h1]

[h1]Usage (server only)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe your server to this.
[*]Add [b]SML.Mut[/b] [u]first[/u] to your list of mutators, example:
[code]
?Mutator=SML.Mut,UnofficialKFPatch.UKFPMutator,AAL.AALMut,DiscordMessage.DMMutator,YAS.YASMut,CTI.CTIMut,CVC.CVCMut,ZedSpawner.ZedSpawnerMut
[/code]
(add/remove [b]compatible[/b] mutators you need)
[/olist]

⚠️ Doesn't work in single player
⚠️ SML must be first in the mutators list or it won't work.
⚠️ SML only has an effect when [b]compatible[/b] mutators are used (the list below). If you use incompatible mutators you will lose ranked status.
⚠️ SML is a server-side mutator, clients never download it. Therefore, no one will know about you using SML if you don’t tell yourself (or if you share with the whole world the BrewedPC folder where you put the SML, lol).
⚠️ SML is incompatible with [url=https://github.com/th3-z/kf2-acpp]AccessPlus[/url] and other mods based on it. If you need something from there, implement it as an SML compatible mutator using [url=https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader/blob/master/DEV.md]developer guide[/url].
