# KF2-SafeMutLoader
Use non-whitelisted mutators and stay ranked.  

# Disclaimer
**SML only uses KF2 and UnrealScript features, it doesn't change game executables or RAM or anything like that, so it's not a hack and it doesn't violate [Killing Floor 2 EULA](https://store.steampowered.com/eula/232090_eula_0).**  

However, [AccessPlus](https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/utility-admin-access-plus-manager.118740) is also not a hack for the same reason, but it is constantly banned in the steam workshop. Why? I dont know.  

**So use this at your own risk!**  

# Usage (server only)
1. Add SML to your server. There are two ways:  
* **without workshop:** download `SML.u` from [releases](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader/releases) and put it to `KFGame/BrewedPC`  
* **with workshop:** Use the [instructions below](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader#build--upload) to build the SML and upload it to your workshop, then subscribe your server to SML  
2. Add `SML.Mut` **first** to your list of mutators, example:  
```
?Mutator=SML.Mut,UnofficialKFPatch.UKFPMutator,AAL.AALMut,DiscordMessage.DMMutator,YAS.YASMut,CTI.CTIMut,CVC.CVCMut,ZedSpawner.ZedSpawnerMut
```
(add/remove **compatible** mutators you need)  

‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't work in single player  
‚ö†Ô∏è SML must be first in the mutators list or it won't work.  
‚ö†Ô∏è SML only has an effect when **compatible** mutators are used (the list below). If you use incompatible mutators you will lose ranked status.  
‚ö†Ô∏è SML is a server-side mutator, clients never download it. Therefore, no one will know about you using SML if you don‚Äôt tell yourself (or if you share with the whole world the `BrewedPC` folder where you put the SML, lol).  
‚ö†Ô∏è SML is incompatible with [AccessPlus](https://github.com/th3-z/kf2-acpp) and other mods based on it. If you need something from there, implement it as an SML compatible mutator using [developer guide](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader/blob/master/DEV.md).  

# Compatible mutators

Purchasing a DLC weapon will unrank the server if currently there is no player with the purchased DLC. This can be bypassed by replacing all DLC weapons with their clones.  
Since KF2 [v1133](https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Update_1133_(Killing_Floor_2)) the content preload causes the server to unrank for some reason. Disable it in CTI settings (`bPreloadContent=False`) to stay ranked.

# Making SML-compatible mutators
See [developer guide](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader/blob/master/DEV.md)  

# Build & Upload
**Note:** If you want to build/test/brew/publish a mutator without git-bash and/or scripts, follow [these instructions](https://tripwireinteractive.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KF2SW/pages/26247172/KF2+Code+Modding+How-to) instead of what is described here.
1. Install [Killing Floor 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/Killing_Floor_2/), Killing Floor 2 - SDK and [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win);
2. open git-bash and go to any folder where you want to store sources:  
`cd <ANY_FOLDER_YOU_WANT>`  
3. Clone this repository and go to the source folder:  
`git clone https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SafeMutLoader && cd KF2-SafeMutLoader`
4. Download dependencies:  
`git submodule init && git submodule update`  
5. Build and upload to steam workshop:  
`./tools/builder -cbu`
6. Find `SafeMutLoader` in your workshop and change `Visibility` to `Unlisted` so your server can download it (don't use `Public` visibility)
